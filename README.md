# UC-3d-game-project-alpha
Small 3d game for UC Game Engine Lab 1

I made a 3d world consisiting of a player, camera, ground, invisible walls, and hills.
I imported a few rocks from the asset store, but I can't figure out the collision.
The camera cannot rotate and is stuck to looking in one direction. This is something I am currently working on.
